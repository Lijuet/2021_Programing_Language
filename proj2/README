Making Scanner and Parser for tiny language.

1. Scanner
Regular expressions split character streams into token stream.
When scanner find the characters which matches regular expressions,
scanner execute action part.
And I return the token to parser.

2. Parser
When scanner delivers tokens, the parser make parse tree based on grammars.
To avoid ambiguity, I define precedence and associativity based on C operator precedence.
If the parser encounter what it can't parse, it throws error.
